# Links to the repo root — one place to edit

`index.html`, `app.js`, and `import-template.csv` here are **symlinks** to the same files in the project root. Edit those files only in the root folder; this app will always use the latest version. Run `npm run link-wealth` in `clerk-nextjs/` if you need to recreate the links (e.g. after a fresh clone).
