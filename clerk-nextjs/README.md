This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It adds Clerk auth and serves the Horizon 60 wealth dashboard at `/wealth` (redirects to `/wealth/index.html`).

**Wealth UI:** The dashboard is **linked** (symlinks) from the repo root—`public/wealth/` points to the same `index.html`, `app.js`, and `import-template.csv` in the root. Edit those files only in the root; there is no second copy. Run `npm run link-wealth` once after a fresh clone if the links are missing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
